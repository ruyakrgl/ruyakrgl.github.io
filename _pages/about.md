### Welcome! 

I am Ruya Karagulle, Ph.D. student in Control field at Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Michigan under the advising of [Necmiye Ozay](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/). My research is mainly focused on formal methods and machine learning, where I am trying to combine the advantages of machine learning with formal methods to infer better specifications for systems.
